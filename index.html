        <h2>Guitar</h2>
        <p>I began playing guitar during summer and strive to make a song this next summer. So far I have gotten into a band and learned how to use a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) </p>

        <h3>Flag Football</h3>
        <p>I was invited by my best friend to this sport to join their team and though it has already ended I'd do it again (Which I am) because I met so many new interesting people, grew stronger, had more motivation, and got closer to my bestfriend</p>

        <h4>Cooking</h4>
        <p>Cooking had always seemed like a thing far from what I'd think of doing, but when I tried so I could start eating healthy and learning how to make food to survive by myself ðŸ’€ and make food for the ones I love it turned out to be enjoyable. Although I have many flaws in this new interest, I continue to grow daily from my mistakes, but never repeat them.  </p>
